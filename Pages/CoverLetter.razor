            <p>Dear Anduril Industries Hiring Team,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-content">
            <p class="mb-4">
                I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer, Battlespace Awareness position at Anduril Industries. Your mission to transform defense capabilities through cutting-edge technology deeply resonates with my passion for innovative engineering and desire to make a meaningful impact.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Throughout my career, I've demonstrated a commitment to pushing technological boundaries and solving complex challenges. My experience developing flight controller software for a custom-built quadcopter and conducting independent research in Neural Network design aligns perfectly with Anduril's focus on autonomous systems and AI-powered solutions. The prospect of contributing to Lattice OS and working on systems that integrate AI, computer vision, and sensor fusion is particularly exciting to me.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                My background in both low-level systems programming (C) and high-level application development (Python, Javascript, C# & Golang) has given me a comprehensive understanding of the full technology stack. During my full stack developement role, I gained valuable experience in distributed systems and algorithm optimization, skills that would be directly applicable to developing high-performance tactical systems at Anduril. Additionally, my recent task of starting and leading a mentorship program for 32 engineers demonstrates my ability to collaborate effectively and contribute to team success.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                The idea of contributing to technology that directly supports autonomous defense capabilities and battlefield awareness is incredibly motivating. As a competitive and driven individual, I'm drawn to Anduril's focus on delivering results quickly. I'm confident that my skills in distributed systems development, AI/ML implementation, flight control systems, leadership, and team collaboration would allow me to make a significant contribution to your team's efforts.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                I am confident that my combination of technical expertise, leadership experience, and passion for innovative technology makes me an ideal candidate for this position. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to Anduril's mission and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm could benefit your team.
            </p>
