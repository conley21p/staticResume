                            Successfully Rolled out a financial sub system upgrade for Illinois Department of Revenue's statewide tax management software. The project's development included implementing financial  processes like tracking revenue accounting, directing, reallocating payments in the system along with many other processes like collections.</p><p>As a Software Engineer Consultant, I've gained valuable experience in building trusted client relationships and delivering successful projects.

                            As a Software Engineer Consultant, we work through three phases in a project. The definition phase is delivering presentations and establishing definition items with a client. The development phase is implementing the solutions and notifying the client of any unexpected scenarios, confirming the best solution is implemented. The testing phase is continued support for the client whether it is presenting tutorials on the new processes or addressing questions and concerns.

                            I was selected to lead the creation and implementation of the mentorship program for our team of 32 engineers at the Illinois client site. In building this program I defined program goals, paired mentors and mentees, and developed a curriculum that focuses on consulting and development skills. As the program lead, I have worked with the team leads and Project Manager to create pairings and establish areas of growth we'd like to see from the individuals in the mentorships. This has quickly become a passion project of mine.

                            Developing in a low level language furthered my foundational software development knowledge. Additionally I worked in high level languages like python and C#. I developed an in-house development tool called Langer. Langer was a Decode manager for the LRS suite of products. Langer allowed initialization of new languages and allowed users to edit decodes for existing supported languages.
