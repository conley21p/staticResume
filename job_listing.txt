Anduril Industries Software Engineer Position

Anduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century's most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril's family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.

Anduril's Software Engineers excel at developing state-of-the art algorithms and software that solve scientific problems with real-world applications. Working in small innovative teams, our software engineers build solutions that make a difference. Our research endeavors don't end once we've written a journal or conference paper describing our technology; rather, our work is complete when our technology has been deployed in mission-critical systems and our customers within government and industry are successful. As science fiction writer Arthur Clarke wrote, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." Anduril is seeking talented "magicians" to join in our mission to expand the boundary of what's possible.
